# Glam Out-of-the-Box Visualizations
This is an OAI-PMH visualization tool for Gallery, Library, Archive and Museum repositories and websites. It pulls metadata out of of a systems OAI-PMH API and then reformats it to let you create a graph of what subjects, locations, or material types are in the collection.  The graphs are created by using interactice D3 javacript templates from D3.js
