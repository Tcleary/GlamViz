# Glam Out-of-the-Box Visualizations
This is an OAI-PMH visualization tool for Gallery, Library, Archive and Museum repositories and websites. It pulls metadata out of of a systems OAI-PMH API and then reformats it to let you create a graph of what subjects, locations, or material types are in the collection.  The graphs are created by using interactice D3 javacript templates from D3.js

## Instructions
  Weâ€™ve aimed to create an easy to use package to harvest and transform metadata from repositories that can be used with a few stock visualizations that wekvenfound and edited. The package works by:
-Pulling the git file
-Going into one of the folders for which type of metadata you would like to view, 
-Editing the harest file to point to the desired repository,
-Running harvest.py,
-Then running flare.py 
-And finally viewing the data set by opening on of the .html files in a webrowser.
